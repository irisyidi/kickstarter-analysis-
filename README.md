## Overview of Project

### Purpose: 

The project is prepared to analyze and visidualize the outcomes of campaign based on their launch dates and funding goals. The project is divided into two subprojects, Outcomes Based on Launch Date and Outcomes Based on Goals. In the Outcomes Based on Lauch Date analysis, the objective is to visualize the theater campaign outcomes (successful, failed or canceled) in different months. In the analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals, the goal is to visualize the percengage of outcomes of plays based on the funding goal amount. 

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

![Outcomes_vs_Goals](https://github.com/irisyidi/kickstarter-analysis-/blob/main/Theater_Outcomes_vs_Launch.png)

The number of successful theater proejcts remarkablely exceeds the number of both canceled and failed theater proejcts from January to December. The number of successful theater proejects reach the highest point in May after an apparent increase with a slight decrease from Febuary to March. From May to December, the successful theater projects present a declining trend from arount 111 to 37 even though there is a temporary increase from 72 to 59 from August to September. The number of failed theater projects overally volatile within the range of 30 to 55. The failed theater projects temporarily present a stable trend from May to August after a increase from 33 to 52 from January to May. As for the canceled theater project, it presents a stable trend within the range of 0 to 8. 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

For the goals set from 0 to 19999, the percentage of successful plays projects surpasses the percentage of failed plays proejcts. But the difference of the percentages of successful projects and failed projects narrowed gradually. For the goals set at 15000 to 19999, the percentages of successful and faield plays projects are equal to 50%. For the goals within the range of 19999 to 34999, the percentage of failed plays projects exceeds the percentage of the success plays projects eventhough the percentage of the faield plays projects presents a decreasing trend with the goals increasing from 25000 to 34999. After keeping constant with the goals range from 35000 to 44999, the percentage of the failed plays projects rise significantly from 33% to 100%, remarketably exceeding the percentage of the successful plays projects for the goals set more than 44999. 

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

In the analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date, the challenges and difficulties encourted are to filter data for theaters to analyze and then to group the column to show the months of the year. As for the analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals, the difficulties and challeges are to use the countifs formula to calculate the number successful, number failed and number canceled. 

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

For the theater projects, it is better the lauch in May with highest possiblity to be successful. 
For the theater projects, the number of the successful outcomes is more than that of the failed outcomes. 

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

There is higher percentage of success if the play projects with the goals of 0-19999 and 35000-44999 are selected. 

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

More than one factors will influence the achievement of the goals and other qualitive factors such as the group of the donators, the content of projects are not into the consideration. 

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?

The tables and graphs that we could create are the graphs of the duration of project and the percentage funded, the graphs of the average doantion with different categories of projects.
